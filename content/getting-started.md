# Getting started

Occam comprises divers sites, services and applications, the documentation for which is somewhat disparate.
This chapter aims to bring it all together.
It also provides some background on the tools and technologies behind Occam, for the curious.

All of Occam is written in JavaScript, which was invented in the mid-nineties. 
It could be said to have languished until the advent of Node.js, hereafter called just Node, in the late naughties.
Node brought several innovations:

* It enabled developers to write web application servers almost almost trivially.
* It provided a straightforward package manager and a site where packages could be published for free and for all of the community to use.
* As well as server side code, developers could write client side code on Node which could be made to run on browsers by way of a process called bundling.

Allied with continued improvements to JavaScript itself, most notably the ES6 and ES7 releases, Node resulted in an explosion in JavaScript's use.
This was especially evidient in, but by no means restricted to, Internet applications.
Both JavaScript and Node continue to evolve and although both have their detractors, it is safe to say that they will be with us and in a healthy state for the foreseeable future.
