# Mastering custom grammars

Custom grammars are one of Occam's defining features.
Occam does not support even basic concepts such as strings and numbers out of the box.
All such concepts need to be defined at a user level and this starts with defining their grammars.
Custom grammars are made for this purpose, allowing Occam's own Florence and controlled natural language grammars to be augmented in order to support user defined terms, statements and metastatements.
Aside from Highmark, little if anything worthwhile can be done with Occam without mastering custom grammars.
