## Exporting custom grammars

The very last toolbar to mention is the grammars toolbar, which only has one button to export the custom grammars.
If a project or package is selected at the time then clicking this button will export the corresponding custom grammar together with the custom grammars on which it depends.
Otherwise the custom grammars for all of the loaded projects and packages will be exported.
