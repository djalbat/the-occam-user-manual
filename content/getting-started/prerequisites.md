## Prerequisites

It almost goes without saying then that in order to use Occam you will need to have Node installed.
In fact the chances are that it already is.
To check this, run the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

```
node --version
```

If something like the following is returned...

```
v18.16.1
```

...then you are in good shape and need do nothing more.
Any major version of Node will do to run Occam, down to major version 12.
If the version that you have installed is older than that or if you just want to install the latest version then go to the Node site here...

https://nodejs.org

...and follow the instructions for your operating system.

Installing Node will also install Node's package manager, called `npm`.
Again you can easily check that it is installed with the following command:

```
npm --version
```

If you have a relatively recent version of Node installed then the version of `npm` will also be recent enough, too.

The only other prerequisite is Git.
Git is version control software invented by Linus Torvalds, of Linux fame.
It revolutionised version control almost instantly upon its release and, as a consequence, revolutionised developer and team workflows.
Alongside Git came the GitHub website.
GitHub enabled developers to share their code with the wider community and, as an aside, along with Markdown it brought readme files to the fore.
You can at a pinch get away without installing Git, at least initially, but if you are going to do any serious work with Occam then you will need it.
Occam's own package manager leverages Git, for example, and the Open Mathematics site allows for GitHub integration.

Git may well already be installed on your system.
In order to check, run the following command:

```
git --version
```

Any version will do since Git has been more than adequate since its initial release.
If you do not have Git installed or want the latest version then go to the Git website:

https://git-scm.com

Installation should be straightforward and no further guidance is given here.
