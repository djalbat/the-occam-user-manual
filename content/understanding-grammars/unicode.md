## Unicode

Any grammar needs a collection of characters or symbols to work with.
In Occam's case this is Unicode, a near ubiliquitous standard that encompasses around 150,000 characters to date and has the capacity to support close to a million more.
These characters are organised across various planes, namely the basic multilingual plane, or BMP for short, together with sixteen so-called astral planes.
For example, the double-struck `‚Ñï` character, being regularly used in mathematical texts, can be found in the basic multilingual plane.
On the other hand the double-struck `ùî∏` character, being far less common, is relegated to an astral plane.
In practice the position of a Unicode character, called its code point, is immaterial.
As mentioned in the previous chapter, the Occam IDE has a Unicode picker to enable you to pick from a large selection of Unicode characters without knowing their code points.
