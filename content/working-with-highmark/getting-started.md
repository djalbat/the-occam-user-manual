## Getting started

It is assumed that you already have `git` and `npm` as well as the Occam IDE installed. 
Installation instructions can be found in the earlier chapters.
Problably the best thing to do next is to jump right in and clone the respository for this book:

```
git clone git@github.com:djalbat/the-occam-user-manual.git
```
