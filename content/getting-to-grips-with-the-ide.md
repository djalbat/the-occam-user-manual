# Getting to grips with the IDE

If you have read the getting started chapter then you will already be somewhat familiar with Occam's IDE.
Actually Occam's CLI tools are not integrated with it as of yet and therefore it is really just a collaborative text editor.
It has some useful points, however:

* It supports Florence, Occam's own language. 
* it has sone indispensible indexing and navigation features.
* It unpacks Occam's packages in its projects pane so that you can browse them as projects. 

Some considerable effort has gone in to making it as usable as possible and most of its functionality should therefore be discoverable.
However, some functionality is subtle or hidden and so all of it is covered in what follows.

To begin with then, note that there are severral toolbars along the top as well as several panes.
All of the toolbars with input fields are sizeable.
Note that if you hover over the buttons then tooltips will appear.
You can turn this off in the settings.
Also note that most of the panes can be minimised in the obvious way.
Moreover the vertical splitters, that is the draggable elements between the panes, can be double-clicked in order to minimise and restore the left and right panes.
