# Getting to grips with the IDE

As mentioned in the getting started chapter, Occam has its own IDE. 
Actually Occam's CLI tools are not integrated with it as of yet and therefore it is really just a useful collaborative text editor.
It supports Florence, Occam's own language. 
It will also unpack Occam's packages in its projects pane so that you can browse them as projects. 
And it has useful indexing and navigation features.
All told it is worth the effort of downloading and installing it and will only improve with time.
Some effort has been made in order to make it as usable as possible and most of its functionaoity should therefore be discoverable.
However, some functionality is subtle or hidden and so all of it is covered in what follows.

To begin with then, note that there are severral toolbars along the top as well as the several panes.
All of the toolbars with input fields are sizeable.
Note that if you hover over the buttons then tooltips will appear.
You can turn this off in the settings.
Also note that most of the panes can be minimised in the obvious way.
Moreover the vertical splitters, that is the draggable elements between the panes, can be double-clicked in order to minimise and restore the left and right panes.
