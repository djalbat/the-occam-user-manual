# Understanding Grammars

Occam's grammars functionality is one of its strong points but what exactly is a grammar, at least in Occam's parlance?
A grammar can loosely be described as that which is needed in order to describe and work with a language.
More specifically, it can be comprised of three parts:

1. A collection of symbols or characters that are the smallest elements of the language. 
These symbols or characters are more often than not considered synonymous with the glyphs that represent them.
In our case a sequence of such characters is what comprises the content of a document or file.

2. A set of rules, usually based on regular expressions, to collect these characters into larger elements, called tokens or lexemes.
We tend to envisage a sequence of characters as continuous rather than discrete and therefore tend to think of these rules as chopping up the content, so to speak.
This process is called lexing or tokenising and we stick to the latter.

3. Another set of rules, more high level, that are responsible for organising these tokens into larger elements.
In the case of natural language these would be phrases, sentences, paragraphs and so on.
This process is called parsing the tokens or, by extension, the content
The resulting structure is usually called an abstract syntax tree or AST for short.
We call it a parse tree, however.

Lastly, not part of this list but equally important is the way in which the parse tree and the tokens themselves are utilised and sometimes maninpulated.
We cover this practice in this chapter, too.

## Language flexibility and extensibility

Consider the following variable declaration written in Occam's default language, called Florence:

```
Variable n:‚Ñï
```

Here we are declaring a variable named `n` to be of natrual number type, represented by the double-struck `‚Ñï` character.
Now look at the parse tree.
This is what Occam sees or, more importantly, what the verifier would see.

```
                                      variableDeclaration [0]                             
                                                 |                                        
               ---------------------------------------------------------------------      
               |                      |               |              |             |      
"Variable"[primary-keyword] [0] variable [0]  ":"[special] [0]   type [0]    <END_OF_LINE>
                                      |                              |                    
                                "x"[name] [0]                  "‚Ñï"[type] [0]              
```

It should be clear from this parse tree that we have a variable declaration to hand, with the aforementioned `n` varaible and `‚Ñï` type.
We imagine that the verifier can extract this information from the parse tree by traversing it somehow, and this is indeed the case.

Now consider the same variable declaration but written in a controlled natural language, or CNL for short.
Occam does not natively support this language as yet but will do so in the future.
It can be created using the grammars sandbox that is the subject of the next chapter, however:

```
Let x be a variable of type ‚Ñï.
```

Here is the resultant parse tree:

```
                                                            variableDeclaration [0]                                                              
                                                                       |                                                                         
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------         
       |              |              |             |                 |                 |               |              |                |         
"Let"[name] [0] variable [0]  "be"[name] [0] "a"[name] [0] "variable"[name] [0] "of"[name] [0] "type"[name] [0]   type [0]    "."[unassigned] [0]
                      |                                                                                               |                          
                "x"[name] [0]                                                                                   "‚Ñï"[type] [0]                    
```

Note that exactly the same information can be extracted from this parse tree as from the previous one, even though the language has changed.
The verifier would be able to ascertain that this is indeed a variable declaration from the topmost `variableDeclaration` node, for example, just as before.
Similarly it could also ascertain that the variable is called `n` and that its type is `‚Ñï`.

In essence, in fact, the parse trees would appear to be identical to the verifier, since it ignores elements that were not pertinent.
The `Variable` keyword in the Florence parse tree would be ignored, for example, or the `Let`, `be` and `a` keywordds in the CNL parse tree.

In summary, for all intents and purposes the Flroence and CNL languages will appear to be identical to the verifier and not just for varaible declarations but everything.
Furthermore, it should be clear that the natural language parts of CNL can be akin to any natural language, it does not have to be English.
This flexibility with languages is an important feature of Occam.

Occam also allows languages to be extended.
Consider the following inference rule.
Quite what an inference rule is or what this one is useful for are not important at this stage:

```
Rule (ModusPonens)
  Premises
    A ‚áí B
    A
  Conclusion
    B
```

Now consider the parse tree of the first of the premises:

```
                         unqualifiedMetastatement [0]        
                                       |                     
                       --------------------------------      
                       |                              |      
                 nonsense [0]                   <END_OF_LINE>
                       |                                     
      -----------------------------------                    
      |                |                |                    
"A"[name] [0] "‚áí"[unassigned] [0] "B"[name] [0]              
```

Note that it does indeed parse, but that it is being parsed as `nonsense`.
This is the fallback or last resort of the grammar, so to speak, if the metastatement cannot be parsed in a more meaningful way.

To make sense of this metastatement, we first augment the grammar with a regular exprssion to pick out the `‚áí` implication symbol as an operator token.
The following parse tree shows that the statement is still parses as nonsense but that this symbol is at least being recognised as an operator:

```
                       unqualifiedMetastatement [0]        
                                     |                     
                      -------------------------------      
                      |                             |      
                nonsense [0]                  <END_OF_LINE>
                      |                                    
      ---------------------------------                    
      |               |               |                    
"A"[name] [0] "‚áí"[operator] [0] "B"[name] [0]              
```

Next, we augment the `metastatement` rule in the grammar to include metastatements of the requisite form:

```
metastatement ::= metavariable "‚áí" metavariable ;
```

As a result of these changes we get a `metastatement` node, not just a `nonsense` one:

```
                            unqualifiedMetastatement [0]         
                                          |                      
                          ---------------------------------      
                          |                               |      
                  metastatement [0]                 <END_OF_LINE>
                          |                                      
        ------------------------------------                     
        |                |                 |                     
metavariable [0] "‚áí"[operator] [0] metavariable [0]              
        |                                  |                     
  "A"[name] [0]                      "B"[name] [0]               
```

What this means in practice is not just a more sensical parse tree.
With this rule now working, so to speak, its premises and conclusion can be matched to other metastatements and statements in derivations by the verifier.
This means that whereas before augmenting the grammar the verifier would have fallen over when encountering this rule, now it would be able to continue.

Indeed it could be said that about half the job of verification is getting content to parse by way of extening Occam's in-built grammars.
As mentioned earlier, there is a grammars sandbox to help you with this work.
Therefore like Occam's flexibility with languages, extensibility is also an important feature.

# Unicode

The first of the points at the beginning of this chapter suggested that any grammar needs a collection of characters or symbols.
In Occam's case this is Unicode, a near ubiliquitous standard that encompasses close to 150,000 characters to date but has the potential to support over a million.
These characters are organised across various planes, namely the basic multilingual plane, or BNP for short, and sixteen what are called astral planes.
For example, the aforementioned double-struck `‚Ñï` character, being regularly used in mathematical texts, can be found in the BNP along with the `‚Ñù`, `‚Ñö` and `‚ÑÇ` characters, also commonly used.
On the other hand the `ùî∏`, `ùîπ` and `ùïä` characters being far less common, are relegated to an astral plane.
In practice the position of a Unicode character, called its code point, is immaterial.
As mentioned in the previous chapter, the Occam IDE has a Unicode picker to enable you to pick from a large selection of Unicode characters without knowing their code points.
Finally mention should go the JuliaMono font, used in the editor, which has support for thousands of Unicode characters.
