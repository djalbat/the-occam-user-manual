# Introduction

I have tried to make Occam[^1] as useable as possible but there are limits.
At the end of the day it is an expert system and some of its parts, not least the verification part, need detailed explanation.
The purpose of this book is to provide these explanations.
it covers not just the IDE and verification but, crucially, Occam's approach to language.
Occam has what might be called a default language or vernacular, called Florence,[^2] but also supports what is called Controlled Naatural Language.
It is an important feature of Occam in fact that the verifier cannot distinguish between these languages at all.


[^1]: The word Occam is used somewhat nebulously here.
It is most often associated with Occam's IDE but in fact it encompasses a range of software and services.
This book explains these divers parts and there is a companion book, called The Foundations of Symbolic Reasoning, that covers the underlying theory.
[^2]: Occam was originally called Florence but the former seemed more apt.
