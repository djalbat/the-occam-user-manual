# Introduction

I have tried to make Occam[^1] as useable as possible but there are limits.
At the end of the day it is an expert system and some of its parts, not least the verifier, need detailed explanations.
It is the purpose of this book is to provide these explanations.

Not only that, it goes into consdierable depth on the subject of Occam's approach to language.
Occam has what might be called a default language or vernacular, called Florence,[^2] but will also support what is called Controlled Naatural Language.
Indded, the verifier cannot distinguish between these languages at all.
This book explains how this comes about as well.


[^1]: The word Occam is used somewhat nebulously here.
It is most often associated with Occam's IDE but in fact it encompasses a range of software and services.
This book explains these divers parts and there is a companion book, called The Foundations of Symbolic Reasoning, that covers the underlying theory.
[^2]: Occam was originally called Florence but the former seemed more apt.
