# Getting started

Occam comprises several applications, sites and services, the installation instructions and further documentation for which are spread across several sites, readme files, etc.
This chapter aims to bring all this information into one place, therefore.
It is a one stop shop for getting started with Occam, so to speak.
It also provices some background on the tools and technologies behind Occam, for the curious.

All of Occam's parts are written in JavaScript.
This language was invented in the mid-nineties and it could be said to have languished until the advent of Node.js, hereafter called just Node, in the late naughties.
Node brought several innovations to JavaScript:

* It enabled JavaScript developers to write web application servers almost trivially.
* It provided an easy to use package manager and a site where packages could be puclibhed for free, for all of the community to use.
* As well server side code, devel9pers could make use of client side libraries and write code to run in broswer via a process called bundling.

Allied with continued improvements of JavaScript itself, most notably the ES6 and ES7 releases, Node resulted in an explosion in the use of JavaScript, especially but by no means restricted to Internet appcliations.
Both JavaScript and Node continue to evolve and although both have their detractors, it is safe to say that they will be with us, and in a healthy state, for the foreseeable future.
