# Getting to grips with the IDE

As mentioned in the getting started section, Occam has its own IDE. 
In fact Occam's CLI tools are not integrated with it as of yet, and therefore it is really what could be described as just a glorified collaborative text editor.  
It has it uses as-is, however. It supports Occam's own vernacular, for example, which is called Florence. 
It will also expand Occam's pac=kages in its projects pane so that you can effectively browse them as projects. 
And it has useful indexing and navigation features. 
All told it is worth the effort of downloading and installing it and will only improve with time.
