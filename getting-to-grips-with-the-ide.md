# Getting to grips with the IDE

As mentioned in the getting started section, Occam has its own IDE. 
In fact Occam's CLI tools are not integrated with it as of yet, and therefore it is really what could be described as just a glorified collaborative text editor.
It has it uses as-is, however. It supports Occam's own vernacular, for example, which is called Florence. 
It will also expand Occam's pac=kages in its projects pane so that you can effectively browse them as projects. 
And it has useful indexing and navigation features. 
All told it is worth the effort of downloading and installing it and will only improve with time.
There are severral toolbars at the top as well as several panes aside from the main editor pane and we cover them in some sort of order.

The first toolbar goes hand in hand with the projects pane, with a recylce bin its files and directories.
The next button will synchronise the document currently being edited with the projects pane, that is select it.
The pencil button allows you to edit the name of the currently selected file or directory.
The next two buttons allow you to create files and directories, respectively.
Both are created in the currently selected directory, if there is one, otherwise in the root projects directory.
As for the projects pane itself, you can drag filea and directories around freely but bear in mind that packages are immutable.
Remember that the topmost directories of packages are shown with a padlock.
One other thing to bear in mind is that by defualt only what are known as recognised files are show in the proejcts pane.
Thus you may see a file appear to disappear if you drag it into a child directory.
You can correct this easily enough in the settings, which we will come to in a while.
